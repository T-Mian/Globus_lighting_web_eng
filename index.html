        <h2>LED lighting – LED Polish luminaires </h2>
        <p>Every industrial plant should has well-litt rooms – it is a priority. As<span>a Polish LED lighting
            producer</span> we know it well, employers also know it and more and more often pay attention to the use of

          – they are cheaper option. The average lifetime of LED lighting is <span> 50 000 hours</span>, traditional
          bulbs only work<span> up to 20 000 hours</span>.</p>
        <p>Another reason why employers choose LED lighting is the fact that it is<span class="span_color_a"> healthier
            for the human
            body</span>. LED lighting produce less IR radiation, what iis positive for human skin. </p>
        <p>LED lighting is primarily<span class="span_color_a"> saving</span>, not only does it last longer, it also
          consumes less electricity.</p>
        <p>Led lighting companies in Poland are also able to choose the right one light intensity or color temperature
          depend on a workplace. The most popular color temperature in the workplaces is white but choosing LED lighting
          exist possibility buy other colors.</p>
